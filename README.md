- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikew003. I created this page in part so I could A) have an online repo of scripts, tasks, steps accessible not only by myself, but for others to effectively share in this knowledge and learn from it, and B), since the start of 2020 I sunk into a deep depression, havent been able to enjoy my professional work, and wanted to share both educational content while providing entertainment values on some pretty neat projects.  
- 👀 I’m interested in Virtualization, hybrid cloud, Microsoft 365, Linux, disk imaging, VDI project management and data.  An amateur web designer and scripter who isnt afraid to open a terminal windows and make some config edits using Nano or powershell.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Content creation and expanding my SEO web server knowledge to share all the 15+ years experience in IT in both an entertaining yet educational format. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on quality technical content.  I am by no means someone who knows everything, and it takes the collaboration from others to get all the technical details right.  All creators whos content I used to create my content will be referenced and linked in the "References" section of the article.
