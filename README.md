- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikew003. Since 2006 I have worked in IT and have never published any of my work outside of my peers and collegues.  
  - I decided to migrate my repo of scripts, projects, tasks, steps, reports and stories into content that can be published publicly to share this knowledge with others and have a little fun doing it.  

  - Originally stored everything on my homelab RAID, 16TB RAW, with a cloud sync to OneDrive/sharepoint where I began by copying essentials I used regurarly, eventually becoming my go to spot for anything I wanted to have access to on my mobile or without VPN.  
  - There were some challenges to this, such as onedrive not actually being a backup, or having to sign in to my O365 account on non secured computers to get a script or command I need, the 1TB limit (not bad per se, just not helpful for all 16TB) plus some other nitpicks I've noticed over the years.  

- Eventually I figured I use github the most of any public repo, and like the interface, why shouldn't I put my scripts and projects here too, and with a public repo I can quickly pull a command or script without having to sign in anywhere!

- 👀 My interests are in Virtualization (KVM (Nutanix, Proxmox, UnRAID, VMM), Hyper-V) VDI, disk imaging, SDS, SDN, hybrid cloud solutions, Microsoft 365 suite, Open Source Software, project management and big data.  Prefers to make their config edits using a text editor.    

- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge on content creation, web design, website management and SEO to build a place where I can put all the 15+ years experience in IT in both an entertaining yet educational format. 
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others on high quality technical content.  I am by no means someone who knows and can do everything, as much as I want to, and it takes collaboration with others to get some things done right.  All creators whos content is used will be referenced and cross linked in all posts.
